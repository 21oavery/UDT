UDT. Ultrasonic Data Transfer. [It's how hackers talk when they don't want to be overheard.](https://youtu.be/O2rGTXHvPCQ?t=17s)

Basically an ultrasonic modem for chat in a school where they monitor everything.

I got this from my school flash drive from last year. Includes TED talk-esque PowerPoint for extra rebellion!

You can tunnel internet to circumvent blocked connections and connect in a meshlike fashion to other nodes.

Mainly just a proof of concept, I never distributed this to my classmates. I'm sure something bad would have happened.

alice.py is the sender, bob.py is the receiver, and caroline.py echoes anything that is sent out. This was stupid. If I ever care about this ever again I might make it logical in some way.

BUT... it works, on every computer I've tested it on. Surprisingly, even Bluetooth can handle the ultrasonic frequencies necessary.
